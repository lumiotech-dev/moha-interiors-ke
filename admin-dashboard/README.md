## 2. UI/UX Design System & Component Library

This section defines the core components and interaction patterns of the Moha Interiors design system. The system is designed to be responsive, accessible, and consistent, ensuring a seamless user experience across all digital touchpoints.

### 2.1. Layout & Spacing

*   **Grid System:** A 12-column responsive grid system will be used for all layouts. The maximum container width will be `1440px`.
*   **Spacing Scale:** A 4-point spacing scale will be used for all padding, margins, and layout adjustments. This ensures consistency and a harmonious rhythm throughout the UI.
    *   `1 unit = 4px`
    *   `2 units = 8px`
    *   `3 units = 12px`
    *   `4 units = 16px`
    *   `6 units = 24px`
    *   `8 units = 32px`
    *   `12 units = 48px`
    *   `16 units = 64px`

### 2.2. Component Library

This library details the design and behavior of the core UI components. All components must be accessible and fully responsive.

**Buttons**

| Type | Style | States | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary** | Solid fill (Muted Gold), Off-White text | Hover: Darken fill, Active: Darken fill further | Primary CTAs (e.g., "Book a Consultation") |
| **Secondary** | Outline (Warm Grey), Warm Grey text | Hover: Solid fill (Warm Grey), Off-White text | Secondary actions (e.g., "View Portfolio") |
| **Tertiary/Text** | No fill, Muted Gold text | Hover: Underline | Low-priority actions, inline links |

**Forms**

*   **Input Fields:** Cool Grey border, Off-White background. On focus, the border changes to Muted Gold.
*   **Labels:** Inter, Medium, 14px. Placed above the input field.
*   **Validation:** Error messages are displayed below the field in Error Red. Success states are indicated with a green border.

**Cards**

*   **Project Cards:** Used in the portfolio gallery. Feature a high-quality image, project title (Playfair Display), and a short description (Inter). A subtle hover effect (e.g., slight zoom on the image) will be used.
*   **Testimonial Cards:** Clean, minimalist design with the testimonial text, client name, and project link.

**Navigation**

*   **Main Navigation:** Clean and simple, with links to the main sections of the site. The active link will be highlighted in Muted Gold.
*   **Mobile Navigation:** A slide-in or full-screen overlay menu for smaller screens, ensuring all navigation items are easily accessible.

**Modals**

*   Used for displaying additional information or forms without navigating away from the current page. Will include a clear close button and an overlay to dim the background content.

### 2.3. Interaction Patterns

*   **Hover States:** All interactive elements (buttons, links, cards) must have a clear hover state to provide visual feedback.
*   **Focus States:** All interactive elements must have a visible focus state (e.g., a Muted Gold ring) for accessibility.
*   **Transitions:** Transitions should be subtle and smooth (e.g., `0.2s ease-in-out`) to create a polished feel without being distracting.
*   **Micro-animations:** Small, purposeful animations can be used to enhance the user experience, such as a subtle fade-in for loaded content or a gentle animation on form submission.

## 3. Theming, Accessibility & Design Tokens

This section outlines the theming strategy, accessibility standards, and the structure of design tokens to ensure a consistent and inclusive user experience.

### 3.1. Theming

The design system will support both a light and a dark theme out of the box, allowing users to choose their preferred viewing mode and providing a premium experience in all lighting conditions.

**Light Mode (Default)**

*   **Background:** Off-White (`#F9F7F7`)
*   **Text:** Charcoal (`#222831`)
*   **Primary Actions:** Muted Gold (`#C0A06F`)
*   **Borders & Dividers:** Cool Grey (`#DBE2EF`)

**Dark Mode**

*   **Background:** Charcoal (`#222831`)
*   **Text:** Off-White (`#F9F7F7`)
*   **Primary Actions:** Muted Gold (`#C0A06F`)
*   **Borders & Dividers:** A slightly lighter shade of Charcoal (e.g., `#3A4750`)

### 3.2. Accessibility (A11y)

Accessibility is a primary consideration. The design system must adhere to **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA** standards.

*   **Contrast Ratios:**
    *   Normal text (Inter) must have a contrast ratio of at least **4.5:1** against its background.
    *   Large text (Playfair Display, 18pt bold or 24pt regular) must have a contrast ratio of at least **3:1**.
    *   All interactive elements and graphics must also meet the **3:1** contrast ratio.
*   **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements must be navigable and operable using only a keyboard.
*   **Semantic HTML:** Use proper HTML5 tags (`<main>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, etc.) to define the structure of the page and assist screen readers.
*   **ARIA Roles:** Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles where necessary to provide additional context for complex components.

### 3.3. Design Tokens

To ensure consistency and facilitate development, all design decisions will be codified as design tokens. These tokens will be the single source of truth for colors, fonts, spacing, and other styles.

**Token Structure (Example in JSON/JS Object):**

```javascript
export const tokens = {
  colors: {
    primary: {
      charcoal: '#222831',
      offWhite: '#F9F7F7',
    },
    secondary: {
      coolGrey: '#DBE2EF',
      warmGrey: '#3F72AF',
    },
    accent: {
      mutedGold: '#C0A06F',
    },
    // ... state colors
  },
  typography: {
    font: {
      heading: 'Playfair Display, serif',
      body: 'Inter, sans-serif',
    },
    size: {
      h1: '3.0rem',
      body: '1.0rem',
      // ... other sizes
    },
  },
  spacing: {
    xs: '4px', // 1 unit
    s: '8px',  // 2 units
    m: '16px', // 4 units
    // ... other spacing units
  },
};
```

### 3.4. Moodboard & Inspiration

*   **Concept:** The moodboard combines architectural photography, natural textures (wood, stone, linen), and minimalist design elements. It evokes a sense of calm, sophistication, and timeless elegance.
*   **Keywords:** Natural Light, Clean Lines, Organic Textures, Understated Luxury, Modern Craftsmanship.
*   **Visuals:** Images of minimalist interiors, close-ups of high-quality materials, and architectural sketches.

## 4. Component Architecture & Implementation Blueprint_x000D_

This section provides an enterprise-grade blueprint for the component architecture, designed for scalability, maintainability, and a seamless developer experience. It adopts the **Atomic Design** methodology to create a structured, hierarchical, and reusable component library._x000D_

### 4.1. Atomic Design Methodology_x000D_

The component library will be structured using the five distinct levels of Atomic Design:_x000D_

1.  **Atoms (Foundational Elements):** The indivisible building blocks of the UI. These include design tokens, base HTML elements, and foundational utilities._x000D_
    *   **Examples:** Labels, Inputs, Buttons, Colors, Fonts, Spacing units, Icons._x000D_
    *   **Implementation:** Defined as base styles, design tokens (CSS variables), and primitive React components._x000D_

2.  **Molecules (Simple Component Groups):** Groups of atoms bonded together to form simple, functional UI components._x000D_
    *   **Examples:** A search form (Label + Input + Button), a navigation link with an icon, a form field with validation._x000D_
    *   **Implementation:** Composable React components that combine several atoms._x000D_

3.  **Organisms (Complex Components):** Relatively complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms._x000D_
    *   **Examples:** The main site header (Logo + Navigation Molecule + CTA Button), a project card (Image + Title + Description), a complete contact form._x000D_
    *   **Implementation:** Higher-order components that manage state and business logic for a distinct section of the interface._x000D_

4.  **Templates (Page-Level Skeletons):** Page-level objects that place organisms into a layout. They define the content structure and skeleton of a page, without the actual content._x000D_
    *   **Examples:** A portfolio page template with a header, a grid of project cards, and a footer._x000D_
    *   **Implementation:** Page-level layout components that accept organisms as props or children._x000D_

5.  **Pages (Specific Instances):** Concrete instances of templates, with real, representative content. This is where the design system is tested for effectiveness._x000D_
    *   **Examples:** The actual, live homepage with real text and images._x000D_
    *   **Implementation:** The final, rendered pages in the Next.js application._x000D_

### 4.2. Frontend Implementation Blueprint (React / Next.js)_x000D_

This blueprint provides a recommended folder structure and best practices for implementing the design system in a Next.js project._x000D_

**Recommended Folder Structure:**_x000D_

```_x000D_
/src_x000D_
|-- /app                 # Next.js App Router_x000D_
|-- /components          # Core UI Component Library_x000D_
|   |-- /atoms_x000D_
|   |   |-- Button.tsx_x000D_
|   |   |-- Input.tsx_x000D_
|   |   |-- Icon.tsx_x000D_
|   |-- /molecules_x000D_
|   |   |-- SearchForm.tsx_x000D_
|   |   |-- FormField.tsx_x000D_
|   |-- /organisms_x000D_
|   |   |-- Header.tsx_x000D_
|   |   |-- ProjectCard.tsx_x000D_
|   |   |-- Footer.tsx_x000D_
|-- /lib                 # Helper functions, utilities_x000D_
|-- /styles              # Global styles and design tokens_x000D_
|   |-- globals.css      # Base styles and CSS variables_x000D_
|   |-- theme.ts         # Design tokens object_x000D_
|-- /templates           # Page-level layout components_x000D_
|   |-- PortfolioTemplate.tsx_x000D_
```_x000D_

**Component API Design (Example: Button Atom):**_x000D_

Components should be designed with a flexible and predictable API using props._x000D_

```typescript_x000D_
// /components/atoms/Button.tsx_x000D_

import React from 'react';

interface ButtonProps extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'tertiary';
  size?: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
  leftIcon?: React.ReactNode;
  rightIcon?: React.ReactNode;
  isLoading?: boolean;
}

export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ 
  variant = 'primary', 
  size = 'medium', 
  ...props 
}) => {
  // ... component logic and styling using clsx/tailwind-merge
  return <button {...props} />;
};
```_x000D_

### 4.3. Theming & Styling Implementation_x000D_

*   **CSS Variables for Theming:** All design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing) will be defined as CSS variables in `/styles/globals.css`. This allows for easy theme switching (light/dark mode) by toggling a class on the `<body>` or `<html>` element._x000D_

    ```css_x000D_
    /* /styles/globals.css */
    :root {
      --background: #F9F7F7; /* Off-White */
      --foreground: #222831; /* Charcoal */
      --accent: #C0A06F;     /* Muted Gold */
    }

    [data-theme='dark'] {
      --background: #222831;
      --foreground: #F9F7F7;
    }
    ```_x000D_

*   **Styling with Tailwind CSS:** Components will be styled using Tailwind CSS utility classes. To avoid class name conflicts and manage variants, `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` should be used._x000D_

### 4.4. Governance & Versioning_x000D_

To ensure the long-term health and scalability of the design system, a clear governance model is required._x000D_

*   **Versioning:** The design system will follow **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**. 
    *   `MAJOR` version for incompatible API changes.
    *   `MINOR` version for adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
    *   `PATCH` version for backward-compatible bug fixes._x000D_

*   **Contribution Process:** A formal process for proposing, reviewing, and implementing new components or changes will be established. This includes design reviews, code reviews, and accessibility checks._x000D_

*   **Documentation:** The design system must be thoroughly documented. A tool like **Storybook** is highly recommended to create an interactive component library where developers can see, test, and learn about each component in isolation._x000D_
